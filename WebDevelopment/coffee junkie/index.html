      Home roasting is the process of roasting coffee from green coffee beans on
      a small scale for personal consumption. Home roasting of coffee has been
      practiced for centuries, using simple methods such as roasting in cast
      iron skillets over a wood fire and hand-turning small steel drums on a
      kitchen stovetop.Until the early 20th century it was more common to roast
      coffee at home than to buy pre-roasted coffee. Following World War I,
      commercial coffee roasting became prevalent and, combined with the
      distribution of instant coffee, home roasting decreased substantially. In
      recent years, there has been a revival in home roasting. What was
      originally a necessity has now become a hobby. The attractions are
      four-fold: enjoying fresh, flavorful coffee; experimenting with various
      beans and roasting methods; perfecting the roasting process, and saving
      money. Other factors that have contributed to the renewed interest in home
      roasting coffee include coffee suppliers selling green coffee in small
      quantities and manufacturers making counter-top roasters.

      In a fancy Parisian Café c. 1960, an uptight businessman man sits at a
      table and orders a coffee. He cannot seem to pay so he begins to stall
      while in the background a disheveled beggar can be seen walking into the
      cafe asking for soar change. Release French Roast was first released in
      France on 30 October 2008 at the Festival Voix d'Etoiles. It was later
      released in the Czech Republic on 3 May 2009 at the AniFest Film Festival,
      in Canada on 19 February 2010 in Waterloo, Ontario and in the USA on 19
      February 2010, limited release.

      The coffee plant had spread to Colombia by 1790.[12] The oldest written
      testimony of the presence of coffee in Colombia is attributed to a Jesuit
      priest, José Gumilla. In his book The Orinoco Illustrated (1730), he
      registered the presence of coffee in the mission of Saint Teresa of
      Tabajé, near where the Meta river empties into the Orinoco. Further
      testimony comes from the archbishop-viceroy Caballero y Gongora (1787) who
      registered the presence of the crop in the north east of the country near
      Giron (Santander) and Muzo (Boyaca) in a report that he provided to the
      Spanish authorities.
